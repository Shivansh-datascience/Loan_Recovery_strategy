# Loan_Recovery_strategy

Overview

The Loan Recovery Strategy Model is designed to assist financial institutions in optimizing their loan recovery processes. By employing clustering techniques, this model categorizes borrowers into three risk groups:

High Risk: Borrowers with a high probability of default, requiring aggressive recovery strategies.

Low Risk: Borrowers likely to repay, needing minimal intervention.

Others: Borrowers with moderate risk levels, requiring tailored recovery approaches.

Features

Machine Learning-based Clustering: Uses clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering) to group borrowers based on repayment behavior.

Data-driven Insights: Identifies patterns in repayment history, credit scores, and financial behavior.

Automated Recovery Recommendations: Provides targeted strategies for each risk group.

Interactive Dashboard: Visualizes borrower segmentation and insights.

Methodology

Data Collection: Aggregating borrower information, repayment history, credit scores, and financial transactions.

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical data.

Clustering Algorithm: Applying unsupervised learning techniques to segment borrowers.

Evaluation & Validation: Assessing cluster quality using metrics like silhouette score.

Deployment: Integrating the model into a loan recovery system.

Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Machine Learning (K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering)

Usage

Data Input: Upload borrower details and financial history.

Run Model: Execute the clustering algorithm.

Review Segmentation: Visualize and interpret the results.

Apply Strategies: Implement recovery strategies based on risk classification.

Future Enhancements
